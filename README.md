## Commits

We use Conventional Commits for commit messages. You can read more about Conventional Commits [here](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). [Here](https://cheatography.com/albelop/cheat-sheets/conventional-commits/) you can find a useful Conventional Commits Cheat Sheet.

We try to make our commits "atomic". [Here](https://www.freshconsulting.com/atomic-commits/) and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_commit) you can read more about Atomic commits.

## VS Code

Following extensions required to simplify the process of keeping the same code style across the project:

- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
- [Stylelint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stylelint.vscode-stylelint)
- [Markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint)

After installation add these lines to your VS Code `settings.json`:

```json
"editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
  "source.fixAll": true
},
"css.validate": false,
"less.validate": false,
"scss.validate": false
```

You can navigate to `settings.json` by using Command Pallete (CMD+Shift+P) and then type "Open settings.json".

Also, make sure that these extensions are installed too:

- [CSS Modules](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=clinyong.vscode-css-modules)
- [GraphQL](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Prisma.vscode-graphql)
- [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker)

## Storybook

[Storybook](https://storybookjs.org) is a tool for previewing and building components in an isolated environment. Storybook also allows us to change props using knobs showing the developer what happens when a specific value is used. We should use this for both a development environment and a documentation tool.

## Style Variables

All style variables that being used across the whole website are stored in [src/styles/variables.scss](/src/styles/variables.scss).
